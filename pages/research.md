#### <a name="Astronomy"></a>Batch Mode Active Learning and Its Application to Astronomy
M.E. Thesis advised by Professor Finale Doshi-Velez and Dr. Pavlos Protopapas.

• Developed a batch-mode cost-sensitive active learning approach that not only exploited uncertainty and representativeness of the whole
unlabeled dataset but also took annotation cost into consideration.

• Designed a selection criterion that combined uncertainty and representativeness by usin
